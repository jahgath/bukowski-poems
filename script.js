'the balance is preserved by the snails climbing the\nSanta Monica cliffs;\nthe luck is in walking down Western Avenue\nand having the girls in a massage\nparlor holler at you, “Hello, Sweetie!”\nthe miracle is having 5 women in love\nwith you at the age of 55,\nand the goodness is that you are only able\nto love one of them.\nthe gift is having a daughter more gentle\nthan you are, whose laughter is finer\nthan yours.\nthe peace comes from driving a\nblue 67 Volks through the streets like a\nteenager, radio tuned to The Host Who Loves You\nMost, feeling the sun, feeling the solid hum\nof the rebuilt motor\nas you needle through traffic.\nthe grace is being able to like rock music,\nsymphony music, jazz…\nanything that contains the original energy of\njoy.\nand the probability that returns\nis the deep blue low\nyourself flat upon yourself\nwithin the guillotine walls\nangry at the sound of the phone\nor anybody’s footsteps passing;\nbut the other probability—\nthe lilting high that always follows—\n\nmakes the girl at the checkstand in the\nsupermarket look like\nMarilyn\nlike Jackie before they got her Harvard lover\nlike the girl in high school that we\nall followed home.\nthere is that which helps you believe\nin something else besides death:\nsomebody in a car approaching\non a street too narrow,\nand he or she pulls aside to let you\nby, or the old fighter Beau Jack\nshining shoes\nafter blowing the entire bankroll\non parties\non women\non parasites,\nhumming, breathing on the leather,\nworking the rag\nlooking up and saying:\n“what the hell, I had it for a\nwhile. that beats the\nother.”\nI am bitter sometimes\nbut the taste has often been\nsweet, it’s only that I’ve\nfeared to say it. it’s like\nwhen your woman says,\n“tell me you love me,” and\nyou can’t.\nif you see me grinning from\nmy blue Volks\nrunning a yellow light\ndriving straight into the sun\nI will be locked in the\n\narms of a\ncrazy life\nthinking of trapeze artists\nof midgets with big cigars\nof a Russian winter in the early 40’s\nof Chopin with his bag of Polish soil\nof an old waitress bringing me an extra\ncup of coffee and laughing\nas she does so.\nthe best of you\nI like more than you think.\nthe others don’t count\nexcept that they have fingers and heads\nand some of them eyes\nand most of them legs\nand all of them\ngood and bad dreams\nand a way to go.\njustice is everywhere and it’s working\nand the machine guns and the frogs\nand the hedges will tell you\nso.\n\n'
